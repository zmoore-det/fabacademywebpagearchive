this video gives me the idea of making machines in the lab. being able to replicate the machine means that you can make it anywhere you can get the parts. Also included is the ability to learn and unnderstand how it works as you make
and use it. versions could be drill press mechanical driven, drill press computer driven, lathe, sheet/dye press machine. all of these types of machines can be made in the lab.

also, I would like to make an electronic bit with a light that you could insert into your machine and get the exact corner or spot of a piece for visual reference. It could have a switch for each direction.
also, a 3d printed screw on attachment with level and laser light

hand drill with re used motor and 3d printed parts or even cardboard parts
